# kudoku
A [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) solver written in Kotlin

It can currently solve most basic Sudokus, but needs improvement to solve harder cases.

#### Future improvements:
- Add more logic to prune candidates ([inspiration](https://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/)).
- Add an A*-algorithm as a fallback bruteforce solver.
- Clean up the code.
